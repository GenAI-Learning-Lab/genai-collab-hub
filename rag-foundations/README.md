# RAG Foundations

> **"Build. Learn. Grow. Together."** - Where hands-on learning meets real-world GenAI challenges.

Welcome to the inaugural program of the GenAI Collab Hub! This comprehensive course will guide you through the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), from basic concepts to advanced, production-ready techniques.

## 🎯 Course Overview

RAG Foundations is designed to take you from beginner to expert in building sophisticated AI systems. You'll learn through hands-on exercises, interactive visualizations, and a real-world case study that demonstrates the power of GenAI.

### Our Use Case: AI-Powered Equity Research System

Throughout this course, we'll build an AI-driven financial analysis system designed to solve real challenges in equity research. Our goal is to create a tool that can answer complex analytical queries in natural language, enabling financial institutions to reduce research costs by 40% and improve trade decision speed by 70%.

## 📚 Course Structure

This course is structured as a progressive journey through 5 comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: Basic RAG
- **Focus**: Foundation concepts and basic implementation
- **Learning**: Understand the fundamental RAG workflow
- **Outcome**: Build a simple, end-to-end RAG pipeline

### Module 2: Improving Recall (Hybrid Search)
- **Focus**: Fix the critical retrieval failure on keywords by implementing a robust hybrid of semantic and keyword search
- **Learning**: Implement robust hybrid semantic and keyword search
- **Outcome**: Significantly improve retrieval accuracy

### Module 3: Improving Precision (Re-Ranking)
- **Focus**: Improve answer quality by using a Cross-Encoder to ensure only the most relevant context is passed to the LLM
- **Learning**: Handle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks
- **Outcome**: Build sophisticated reasoning capabilities

### Module 4: Measuring Performance (RAG Evaluation)
- **Focus**: Introduce a quantitative framework to objectively measure the improvements made in the previous modules
- **Learning**: Objectively measure improvements and optimize systems
- **Outcome**: Production-ready evaluation and monitoring

### Module 5: Autonomous Systems (Agentic RAG)
- **Focus**: Give our system a "brain" by building an autonomous agent that can reason and decide which tool is the right one to use for a given query
- **Learning**: Build agents that can reason and select appropriate tools
- **Outcome**: Enterprise-grade, scalable RAG system
