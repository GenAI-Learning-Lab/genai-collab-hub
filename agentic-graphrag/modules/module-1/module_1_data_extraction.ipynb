        "\n",
        "**Answer**: We invoke the LLM in `process_contract` with `await structured_llm.ainvoke(contract_data[\"text\"])`. The prompt is simply the contract's raw text (`contract_data[\"text\"]`). Structured output is enforced by `llm.with_structured_output(Contract)`, which instructs the LLM to return data matching the `Contract` Pydantic schema—no explicit prompt template is shown; the schema guides the output format.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Question**: What is the role of the Pydantic schema in this workflow?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: The Pydantic schema (the `Contract` class) defines the structure and types of the data we want to extract from each contract. When we use `llm.with_structured_output(Contract)`, the LLM is guided to produce output that matches this schema, ensuring consistency and type safety in the extracted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: Why don't we need to write a custom prompt template for the LLM?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: Because we use `with_structured_output` with a Pydantic schema, the LLM is automatically instructed to return data in the required structured format. This approach leverages the schema as a \"contract\" for the output, so a custom prompt template is not necessary for basic extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: What if LLM is not extracting all the clause types mentioned in the original contract document?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: If the LLM is not extracting all clause types, you can absolutely write a custom prompt to improve extraction. This is possible and often effective. A custom prompt allows you to give the LLM more explicit instructions, such as asking it to carefully identify every clause, use a specific set of clause types, or even output in a particular format. You can also provide examples (few-shot prompting) to show the LLM exactly how you want the extraction to work. For instance, you might instruct: \"Extract all clauses from the contract below. For each clause, assign it to one of these clause types: [list of types]. If a clause does not fit, use 'Other'. Output the results as a JSON list with 'summary' and 'clause_type' for each clause.\" This approach can help the LLM be more thorough and accurate, especially if you notice consistent omissions with schema-only guidance.\n",

        "**Answer**: If the contract text does not contain information for a required field, the LLM may return `null` (or `None` in Python) for that field, or it may attempt to infer or leave it blank.
