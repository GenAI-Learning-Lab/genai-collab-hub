Ingredients will be produced at Supplier's facilities listed in a Master Purchase Commitment, or any other of Supplier's facilities approved in advance, in writing by AGL.\\n\\n1.2 AGL or its TPMs will place specific orders for Ingredients from Supplier by issuing a purchase order that specifies, at minimum, the item, quantities, price, delivery dates, and delivery and payment terms (each a \\\"Purchase Order\\\").\\n\\n1.3 AGL and Supplier may enter certain Master Purchase Commitments from time to time during the Term of this Master Supply Agreement. Such Master Purchase Commitments and any Purchase Orders issued against such Commitments shall be subject exclusively to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event the terms of any Master Purchase Commitment conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Master Purchase Commitment shall control.\\n\\n1.4 Supplier will receive Purchase Orders by telephone, USPS, overnight courier, email, and fax transmission, Monday through Friday except on state or nationally recognized bank holidays. Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following business day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier. Each Purchase Order issued by AGL or its TPMs and accepted by Supplier shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Additional terms included in acknowledgments, standard terms and conditions, or any other documents or communications exchanged by the Parties in connection with the sale or purchase of any Ingredients shall be void and of no force or effect. The Parties may only modify, add to or amend any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.\\n\\n1.5 Supplier represents and warrants that at the time and date of delivery, the Ingredients will comply with all specifications (\\\"Specifications\\\"), a copy of which will be attached to the relevant Master Purchase Commitment or Purchase Order accordingly. A Specification may be updated from time to time by AGL in its sole discretion, provided AGL provides Supplier with reasonable prior notice on any updates (\\\"Change Notification\\\"). Within [***] from receipt of the Change Notification, Supplier will either: (1) accept the Specification change at the current price and terms; or (2) submit to AGL a proposal (\\\"Proposal\\\") setting forth the conditions of acceptance that may include a change in price and/or other terms, including documentation to support same. Within [***] the Parties will discuss the Proposal in good faith and exercise their best efforts to agree on the appropriate adjustment if any. AGL will not issue any Purchase Orders, nor be required to issue any Purchase Orders to Supplier until AGL and Supplier have agreed on required Ingredient Specifications and any associated price and/or term adjustment. In the event the Parties fail to agree on required Ingredient Specifications or price and/or term adjustments despite their best good faith efforts, neither Party will have any further obligation with regard to purchase or supply of those Ingredients under any Master Purchase Commitments except that AGL shall take and pay for [***] of Ingredient inventory manufactured according to the then-current Specification.\\n\\n1.6 Supplier will provide a Certificate of Analysis (\\\"COA\\\") completed in accordance with the Specifications with any shipment of Ingredients.\\n\\n1.7 INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\\n\\n1.8 This Agreement is nonexclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Parties will supply and purchase Ingredients from the other Party. Nothing herein is intended to, nor does, guarantee that either Party will supply or purchase any specific, item, in any specific quantity, or conclude any business transaction with the other.\\n\\n1.9 Supplier Performance metrics will be identified and tracked periodically through Supplier Performance Review meetings no more frequently than each calendar quarter during the Term. [***] Metric targets will be established by AGL and agreed by Fonterra and updated as needed. The ultimate goal is zero defects for quality and administrative compliance issues.\\n\\n1.10 Supplier agrees to make a good faith effort to provide Advance Ship Notices (\\\"ASN\\\") with bar-coded pallet labels; Invoices, Purchase Orders and other business transactions, as may be advised by AGL, for each Ingredient shipment. Supplier will provide, itself or through a third-party provider, the information via Electronic Data Interface (\\\"EDI\\\") if and as requested by AGL. The technical specifications for all required EDI transactions will be provided by AGL.\\n\\n2 Quality and Food Safety\\n\\n2.1 For the purposes set forth in Section 303(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \\\"Act\\\"), Supplier guarantees to AGL that as of the time and date of delivery, all Ingredients will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the Act, nor will any Ingredients constitute an article that may not, under the provisions of Sections 404 and 505 of the Act, be introduced into interstate commerce. The Supplier further guarantees that as of the time and date of delivery, all of the Ingredients will be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, requirements and programs including those administered by the Food and Drug Administration (the \\\"FDA\\\"), the United States Department of Agriculture (the \\\"USDA\\\") and any state or local food or drug laws then in effect. This guarantee specifically includes Proposition 65 (California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act), and Supplier hereby certifies that the Ingredients will not contain any non-naturally occurring chemicals subject to Proposition 65 or that any such chemicals pose \\\"no significant risk\\\" or cause \\\"no observable effect\\\" as set forth in the California Health and Safety Code, 22 CCR \\u00a7\\u00a7 12701 et seq. and 22 CCR \\u00a7\\u00a7 12801 et seq., as amended. Supplier shall comply with all applicable regulatory requirements for determining and documenting that all Ingredients are at or below no significant risk levels and no observable effect levels, as applicable.\\n\\n2.2 Supplier shall develop and maintain a food safety/food defense program as required under the Food Safety Modernization Act 21 USC \\u00a7301 et seq and shall submit a copy of such plan (and any changes thereto) to AGL upon AGL's request. Supplier will conduct [***] third-party food safety/food defense audits (the \\\"Audits\\\") in compliance with, and consistent with, relevant audit schemes approved by the Global Food Safety Initiatives, AIB International, Silliker, or GMA SAFE. Supplier will submit summaries of audit reports to AGL's Quality Manager at [***] upon request. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.2 will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n2.3 Supplier will notify AGL immediately, by person-to-person voice communication or equivalent means, if any of the Ingredients contain, or are reasonably suspected to contain, material hazardous to human health, including but not limited to, chemical, physical or biological hazards.\\n\\n2.4 AGL shall notify Supplier in writing if it determines any Ingredient fails to meet the Specifications. Supplier shall be given an opportunity to and will promptly inspect and/or test such Ingredients to confirm compliance to Specification. If after any reasonable, good faith inspection and testing it is confirmed that certain Ingredients fail to meet the Specifications [***].\\n\\n2.5 Subject to the occurring of a Force Majeure Event, if Supplier fails to deliver the Ingredients in accordance with the Specifications, including within the time specified on the Purchase Order, in addition to any other remedies available, AGL may terminate the Purchase Order in whole or in part. In the event of such a termination, Supplier shall continue performance of any nonterminated portion of the Purchase Order, or any nonterminated Purchase Orders, and the quantity of Ingredient ordered and so terminated shall be deducted against any relevant Master Purchase Commitment.\\n\\n2.6 AGL or its contracted third-party auditors may enter and audit/inspect Supplier's facilities where the Ingredients are produced, stored, packaged or otherwise processed [***] unless food safety is at issue or AGL has a good faith reason to believe the Ingredients are being stored, packaged, or processed in a way that is inconsistent with the Specifications, in which case an audit may be performed at any time during the Term. For routine visits and audits, AGL will provide [***] if facilities located in the US and with [***] if facilities are located [***], provided that such examination will be conducted during Supplier's normal business hours and in such a manner as to reasonably minimize disruption to Supplier's business, unless food safety is at issue, in which case such examination may be conducted at any time. Supplier shall cooperate in good faith with AGL during all such inspections.

        "**Question**: Where are we invoking the LLM and which prompt are we using to get structured output?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: We invoke the LLM in `process_contract` with `await structured_llm.ainvoke(contract_data[\"text\"])`. The prompt is simply the contract's raw text (`contract_data[\"text\"]`). Structured output is enforced by `llm.with_structured_output(Contract)`, which instructs the LLM to return data matching the `Contract` Pydantic schema—no explicit prompt template is shown; the schema guides the output format.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Question**: What is the role of the Pydantic schema in this workflow?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: The Pydantic schema (the `Contract` class) defines the structure and types of the data we want to extract from each contract. When we use `llm.with_structured_output(Contract)`, the LLM is guided to produce output that matches this schema, ensuring consistency and type safety in the extracted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: Why don't we need to write a custom prompt template for the LLM?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: Because we use `with_structured_output` with a Pydantic schema, the LLM is automatically instructed to return data in the required structured format. This approach leverages the schema as a \"contract\" for the output, so a custom prompt template is not necessary for basic extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: What if LLM is not extracting all the clause types mentioned in the original contract document?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer**: If the LLM is not extracting all clause types, you can absolutely write a custom prompt to improve extraction. This is possible and often effective. A custom prompt allows you to give the LLM more explicit instructions, such as asking it to carefully identify every clause, use a specific set of clause types, or even output in a particular format. You can also provide examples (few-shot prompting) to show the LLM exactly how you want the extraction to work. For instance, you might instruct: \"Extract all clauses from the contract below. For each clause, assign it to one of these clause types: [list of types]. If a clause does not fit, use 'Other'. Output the results as a JSON list with 'summary' and 'clause_type' for each clause.\" This approach can help the LLM be more thorough and accurate, especially if you notice consistent omissions with schema-only guidance.\n",
